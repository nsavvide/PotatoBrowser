## Development Guide

### Architecture

Like many FFI crates, there are two crates in this repo: `cef-rs` in root and `cef-sys` in sys directory. `cef-sys` contains C APIs generated by `bindgen.sh`. You shouldn't edit the code directly in this crate. `cef-rs` is where type safe bindings land. Most features and implementation should go here.

### Types

There are a few types we recommend you learn first before adding any implementation. This could help you understand the interface of CEF better. We also welcome everyone who can add tests for these types:

- [`cef::string`](https://docs.rs/cef/latest/cef/rc/index.html)
- [`cef::rc`](https://docs.rs/cef/latest/cef/string/index.html)
